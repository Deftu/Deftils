# Mango - Simple core JVM library.

</div>

## Why should I use it?

Mango provides new collection types and utility classes. To put it in short, it's only for your own Quality of Life.

## Deprecated features, how long until they're removed?!

Once a class or method has been deprecated, a label will be added indicating when it was deprecated in the version timeline. The feature will most likely be removed within the next 3-5 updates.

## Adding Mango to your project.
Mango's group is `xyz.matthewtgm`, it's artifact name is `Mango` and the version is dependant on the latest release's tag.

### Maven:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>xyz.matthewtgm</groupId>

    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
```
